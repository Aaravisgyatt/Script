# Script
Just a simple package manager for linux I made
sudo install command is sudo ./script install 
It can: install and remove packages, list installed packages and list Repository information, install packages from repositories, do system wide installs via sudo and is designed for linux distros
Will add future updates.
This is all made by me and I should be credited
