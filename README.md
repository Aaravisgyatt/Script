# Script - package manager for linux
Just a simple package manager for linux I made
sudo install command is sudo ./script install 
It can: install and remove packages, 
read manifests, 
has dependency management, 
can upgrade packages, 
has safe uninstall, 
has file tracking, 
has multi repo / mirror support, 
has checksum verification, 
has sandboxed installation, 
can list installed packages, 
can show package info, 
can log with timestamps, 
has versioning with script --version and 
has a license
Will add future updates.
This is all made by me and I should be credited.
